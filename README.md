# MobileMortgageCalculator
In my Mobile Development class I completed a very basic mobile application that allows you to calculate the monthly mortgage payment given the total cost, interest rate, and the loan period.
The Main xml file is how I chose to display the input sections on the application for the users to input their values. Of course I can always design it nice and make it look very appealing to the eye but for now its just as simple as that. In the java file I was able to connect the sections together by creating the variables, calling them, and then allow them to do the calculation of the mortgage once the BUTTON is clicked. Enabling the button to output the monthly payment calculated in the middle of the screen.
